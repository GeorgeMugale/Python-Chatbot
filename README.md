# UJ JBS Chatbot ‚Äì Final Presentation Day Project

## Overview

This project is a Python-based chatbot developed for the **University of Johannesburg Johannesburg Business School (UJ JBS)** as part of our final presentation day. The chatbot serves as a smart Q&A assistant, capable of engaging users through an intuitive graphical interface while showcasing a variety of advanced and creative functionalities.

## Features

- üß† **Dictionary-Based Q&A System**  
  The core of the chatbot is powered by a dictionary-driven knowledge base, allowing it to quickly retrieve and respond to predefined queries in a structured manner.

- üñºÔ∏è **Graphical User Interface (GUI) with Tkinter**  
  A user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter enhances interactivity, making the chatbot easy to use and visually accessible for demonstrations and general usage.

- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Hot-Swapping Integration**  
  Developed as part of a **collaborative team effort**, the chatbot supports hot-swapping. This feature allows seamless integration of different modules from team members without interrupting the main application workflow.

- üåê **Web Scraping for Dynamic Information**  
  To handle complex or previously unknown queries, the chatbot uses **web scraping techniques** to retrieve relevant information in real time, expanding its responsiveness beyond the static knowledge base.

- üê¢ **Turtle Graphics Integration**  
  Going beyond text-based interaction, the chatbot includes creative functionality using Python‚Äôs `turtle` graphics module:
  - Users can command the bot to draw **basic geometric shapes**.
  - The chatbot is also capable of rendering **fractal patterns**, combining creativity with computational thinking.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** ‚Äì for GUI development
- **Turtle Graphics** ‚Äì for drawing shapes and fractals
- **BeautifulSoup / requests** ‚Äì for web scraping
- **Custom Python modules** ‚Äì for Q&A logic and hot-swapping

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Install required libraries (if applicable):
   ```bash
   pip install beautifulsoup4 requests
````

4. Run the main chatbot script:

   ```bash
   python AUTO.py
   ```

## Project Context

This chatbot was presented during the **UJ JBS Final Presentation Day** as a demonstration of our team's programming and problem-solving skills. It highlights our ability to work collaboratively, integrate diverse technologies, and apply both technical and creative approaches to software development.

## Teamwork Highlight

This project was a result of effective **team collaboration**, where modular development and integration strategies like hot-swapping were crucial to maintaining code cohesion and workflow efficiency.
